# Executive Summary Assistant

This project is a **Flask web application** that uses **OpenAI GPT** to generate **executive summaries** for business proposals.

ðŸ‘‰ You provide a **provider profile** (your company details) and a **client context** (clientâ€™s name, industry, goals, and the recipientâ€™s role such as CEO/CFO/CTO/etc.).
ðŸ‘‰ The app generates:

* **Value Selling Points (VSPs)** â€“ short, powerful business phrases.
* **Executive Summary** â€“ a polished, client-ready document with clear structure.
  ðŸ‘‰ You can refine the summary in a **chat-like interface** and finally **download it as a Word (.docx) file**.
